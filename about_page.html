        <p>I take photos because it makes me happy to capture a moment with someone I love or something I find beautiful or inspiring. I started out photographing
            my dog, but have since explored landscape and wildlife photography, done a lot of birding and bird photography, and 
            dabbled in astrophotography when the opportunity arises. I currently shoot with an iPhone 12 Pro or a Sony a6000. I have a Sigma 30mm lens 
            I use for dog and human portraits and landscapes, a very wide angle Rokinon 12mm for astrophotography and a Sony 55-210mm baby telephoto 
            lens for birding, primarily.</p>
        <p>I am currently a Masters student at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor at the School of Information and studying user experience 
            research and design. My first semester, I had the opportunity to enter a photo competition with the theme of sky. I entered a photo 
            I'd taken of the Milky Way and was surprised, honored, and thrilled to win 1st place!</p>
