        <p>Start with what you have! Thanks to smartphones with increasing camera quality, millions of us have access to a more 
            than capable camera. Years ago, I got seriously into photography with an old iPhone and a determination 
            to capture the magic of my beloved dog at the beach. Since my dog passed at nearly 17 years old in 2021, some of those photos 
            I took of him on my first iPhone remain my favorites of the thousands I took of him. The most important thing I learned 
            shooting on an iPhone was how to compose shots and that sometimes the best shot requires us to squat or kneel on the ground 
            (hello, dog photography!) and the quality of your natural lighting and your angle to the light source is the secret ingredient 
            to fabulous shots you'll keep forever. All the following photos were taken on an iPhone:</p>

        <p>No matter what camera you use, understanding some principles of photography can give you more shots you're happy with, 
            and hopefully some you're thrilled with! A good place to start is knowing terms like exposure, composition, and resolution, which 
            are impacted by aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and lens length or zoom. Check out the technical explanations below for 
            a beginner-friendly rundown of these terms to get you started.</p>
